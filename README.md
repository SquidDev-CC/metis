A collection of useful modules for ComputerCraft/CC: Tweaked. There's not much rhyme or reason to this really, so feel
free to PR useful libraries you might have.

## Tips for developing
 - Assuming you've got CCEmuX installed, you can start it in the current directory by running `bin/ccemux.lua`.
 - _Within CC_ (or an emulator), `bin/mcfly.lua` will run the (rather lacklustre) test-suite.
